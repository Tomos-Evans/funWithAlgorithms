# Fun With Algorithms
This is a place where I play around with some algorithmic problems. The source of the questions varies. some come from the "[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)" book, others come from of the Google Technical Interview Guides, and a few come from problems that I face while studying Computer Science.

## Questions
1. Finding a pair of integers in an array that sum to a specific value
2. Recycling letters from a printing press
