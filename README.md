# Fun With Algorithms
This is a place where I play around with some algorithmic problems. The source of the questions varies. some come from the "[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)" book, others come from of the Google Technical Interview Guides, and a few come from problems that I face while studying Computer Science..

I am aiming to solve all of the problems in a few different languages, including Python, Java, C and Haskell.
