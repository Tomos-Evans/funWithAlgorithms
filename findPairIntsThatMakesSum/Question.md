# The Question

The aim of this problem is to find a pair of integers in an array that add up to a specified value.

For Example:

    [1,2,3,9]       sum = 8

Has no valid solutions, but:

    [1,2,4,4]       sum = 8

Has a solution at the indexes 2 and 3.

# Constraints
- The List is ordered
- There can be repeating values
- Dont need the indexes, only need to know if there is a valid solution



# Extension
What if the input array was not ordered?
