# The Question

Imagine that there was an old fassioned printing press set up to print a book. You only have the letters that are in the press, and no more. Determine whether you can print a different text using only the same letters

# Constraints
- Each letter stamp can only be used once
- The letter stamps are case sensitive
- You need to concider punctuation
